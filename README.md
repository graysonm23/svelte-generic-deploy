# Simple Svelte User Login Feature

More Features to come soon, as this is just a side project. I would love to incorporate more features for everyone. Please let me know what you think. If you like it please give it a star.

-- This is a full stack application using Node.js, MongoDB, Svelte, and Express.

## Get started

Git Clone...

`git clone https://github.com/graysonm23/User-Login-Svelte.git`

Install the dependencies...

```bash/terminal
cd User-Login-Svelte
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run buid
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

## Updates

Integrated tailwind css to project.
